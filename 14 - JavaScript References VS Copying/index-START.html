      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);
      age = 200;
      console.log(age, age2);// only age is updated as age2 is a copy

      let name = 'Alice';
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = 'Alice Malice';
      console.log(name, name2);// only name is updated as name2 is a copy
      
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(team, players);
    
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[2] = 'Alice';
    console.log(team, players); // both arrays are updated because team is a reference to the original array and not a copy.
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    let team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = 'Lux';
    console.log(team2, players);// only team2 is updated as it is a copy - not a reference - of players
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Jen';
    console.log(team3, players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[0] = 'Alice';
    console.log(team4, players);
    

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[1] = 'Leona';
    console.log(team5, players);
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);
    // both objects are pudated as captain is a reference not a copy!!

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:85});
    console.log(captain2, person);
    // captain2 is a copy and is the only object updated.

    // ...spread
    const captain3 = {... person};
    captain3.number = 12;
    console.log(captain3, person);
    
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const alice = {
      name:'Alice Houel',
      number: 39,
      social:{
        facebook:'alice.houel',

      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(alice);
    const alice2 = {...alice};
    alice2.social.instagram = 'alicemarguerite';
    console.log(alice, alice2);// both objects are updated with new instagram value because Object spread only copies 1 level deep. the rest is a reference.

    const alice3 = Object.assign({}, alice);
    alice.name = 'Alice Malice';
    console.log(alice, alice3);
    alice.social.facebook = 'amhouel';
    console.log(alice, alice3); // both objects are updated with new facebook value because Object.assign only copies 1 level deep. the rest is a reference.
    
    // we can use clone deep if we really need to - not recommended:
    const alice4 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(alice));
    alice4.social.instagram = 'alicemalice79';
